# fsl_prototype

Prototype for the FSL Study to be presented

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Source Code
The original source code was from https://github.com/MCarlomagno/FlutterMobilenet. I tried to forked it but it would be a hassle to fix all of the errors.
